analyzed the education scenario in Gujarat and felt that it was 
imperative to dispel the many myths pertaining to entrance exam 
preparation from the minds of students. They realized that it would be 
only through proper mentoring and world class pedagogy that these young
 minds would get a proper direction.<br>
<br>
 <strong class="arial12bold">The Genesis:</strong><br>
 On September 5, 2004, Endeavor started putting its 
theory to the test by beginning the training and mentoring a few 
students from various academic backgrounds with the help of a unique 
pedagogy, indigenously designed course material, and an exhaustive test
 series. This was but a trial, an experiment to examine the veracity of
 their methods. At its core was a very driven and dedicated faculty 
team. The faculties themselves had taken up the entrance examinations, 
and hence were thoroughly familiar with the exam patterns and the rigor
 required to crack these exams. The mentoring and the diligence invested
 in the students finally came to fruition in December and the students 
cracked all the major entrance examinations. This was a very 
commendable achievement which did not go unnoticed in the education 
industry. It actually created a wave amongst those who matter – the 
students who prepare for the entrance exams. The message was clear: You
 need not be a genius to crack an entrance exam. You need the proper 
guidance and the requisite preparation.&nbsp; “If you can dream it, you can 
achieve it.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 This was how the foundation of Endeavor Careers was 
laid. The very visible success of their effort made the people behind 
Endeavor realize that this was the perfect time to launch their brand 
commercially as a training institute. The journey towards market 
leadership had begun. As the cliché goes, from then on, there has been 
no looking back. From a small, 300 - square feet office – cum – 
classroom to six sprawling study centers all across Gujarat.<br>
<br>
 By November 2005, Endeavor had carved a niche for 
itself in management education. CAT 2005 was not only the test of the 
students’ ability but also a final proving ground for Endeavor. Actions
 do speak louder than words and when more than 20 Endeavor students 
scored upwards of 90 percentile on CAT 2005 they proved Endeavor’s 
philosophy outright. That year, Endeavor produced a result which was 
unmatched in Gujarat. More than 10 students out of a total of 50 had 
final admissions to India’s top Business Schools like IIM Lucknow, IIM 
Kozhikode, IIM Indore, MDI Gurgaon, IIFT, S.P. Jain Mumbai, Narsee 
Monjee Institute of Management Studies, IMT Gaziabad, Nirma Institute 
of Management and UBS Chandigarh.<br>
<br>
 Since its inception, Endeavor has vigorously responded
 to the stimulus of implementing innovative methods of preparation and 
instruction. The growth process has been accompanied by a focus on 
understanding the student mind, their viewpoint and aspirations, and 
guiding them through their preparation accordingly.<br>

 If there is a way, we will find one. If there is none, we will make one.</p><p><br></p></div>
